		<h3>About my blog</h3>
		<p>
			My blog posts are mostly opinion pieces on what I think about a particular topic in relation to technology. I don't usually do full reviews of products (there are enough websites out there that cover reviews of products) but any products mentioned (both hardware or software) I will either own myself or at the very least, tried out for an extensive period of time.
